# TicTacToe
contains code for tictactoe game in shell script

This is a very simplified version of Tic Tac Toe Game.
Code contains 6 functions (1 main function and 5 other functions)

I started to code this with two human players then refactored it and added computer player
instead of 2nd human player.Here computer simply choose a random number from 0-9 and places
it in a cell.

Execution starts from main where first board is displayed using display function then input 
is received from human first then computer. This goes on till any one player wins the game or draws.

At the end of game it shows history of all human as well as commputer moves.

I know more code refactoring is needed since human has higher probablity to win this game.
Refactoring of computer playing like human is needed in code. So that both play equally and
game becomes more interesting!.
